## Usage
To use this yourself you will need to create a twitter account and goto https://apps.twitter.com to register a twitter application.
Once you have a twitter application registered you will have an *app-id* and an *app-secret* that you will need to enter into the application.properties file in the resources folder.

Then just run the application as usual and go to http://localhost:8080/{your-favourite-twitter-account}
